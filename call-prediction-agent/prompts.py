            Analyze the claims and prior authorization details for a given user_id {user_id} using available tools to predict the 
            potential reasons for a user call to a pharmacy benefit manager call center.
            - Extract and evaluate claims and prior authorization information for the provided user_id.
            - Formulate a prediction on the potential reasons the user might be calling. The prediction should be a list of strings.
            - Your prediction list **MUST** contain one or both of the following strings: 'CLAIMS' or 'PRIOR_AUTHORIZATION'.
            - Justify the prediction based on the userâ€™s recent claims or authorization history.
            - Provide any relevant supporting information related to the prediction, such as claim or authorization IDs.
            - Think step by step and arrive at a prediction. 

            # Steps

            1. **Access Data**: Retrieve claims and prior authorization details using the user's ID.
            2. **Analyze History**: Examine the timeline and status of claims and prior authorizations to identify recent or significant actions.
            3. **Predict Call Reason**: Based on the analysis, predict the likely reason for the user's call. Consider the recency and significance of events.
            4. **Justify Prediction**: Provide reasoning for the prediction based on the data analyzed.
            5. **Provide Supporting Info**: Include any specific claim or authorization IDs relevant to the prediction.
